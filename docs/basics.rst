Basic Structure

Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~
An organization within Expopulo is comprised of a staking mechanism, a set of administrators, self-specific
contributions, and a collection of projects. The purpose of an organization is to provide an administrative
and financial structure for an open contribution system. Once an organization is created, projects can be
subsequently created in conjunction with the organization. In this way, the organization's purpose is to
provide a singular identity for a collection of projects with a shared goal as defined by the details of the
organization. The organization also serves as an entry point to contributions directed to the organization in
general, rather than to more specific in projects or tasks. These organization contributions can then be
distributed to the specific projects and tasks as the organization's administrators see fit.


Project
~~~~~~~
A project is comprised of self-specific contributions and a collection of related tasks. The purpose of a
project is to provide a more specific and narrow-focused subset of the goals defined by the organization. Much
like an organization, contributions can be made specifically to the project itself and distributed to tasks as
the administrators see fit. However, unlike organization contributions, project contributions made
specifically to projects cannot be distributed back to the organization itself. This is established to provide
separation between what is a contribution to the organization as a whole and a contribution to a specific
project as deemed by those individuals who are contributing.


Task
~~~~
A task is comprised of self-specific contributions and a collection of submissions. The purpose of a task
is to provide an exit point for all contributions made anywhere within an organization. A task can be loosely
defined as a singular goal that, if accomplished, through the use of a submission, will result in payment to
the individual or entity which completed it. Much like that of a project, contributions can be made
specifically to the task itself and cannot be recalled back to a higher level within the organization, as they
were made specifically to the task itself.


Submission
~~~~~~~~~~
A submission is a singular unit which serves as an attempt to complete the necessary goals of a task. Should a
submission adequately satisfy the goals of the task, the creator will then receive payment taken from the
contributions made and assigned to the task.


Administrator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An administrator acts as the governing body over the creation and modification of the organization itself, its
projects, and its tasks. Additionally, administrators are tasked with the movement and distribution of
contributions made within the organization. Administrators are able to distribute and recall contributions as
they see fit, so long as they remain within the scope of where they were contributed. Finally, administrators
are tasked with the assessment, approval, and payment disbursement to any and all task submissions.


Staking & Moderation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The staking mechanism tied to an organization allows individuals that contribute to an organization to be able
to have a stake in the administration of the organization. When a contribution is made to an organization, an
individual's stake to the organization is equivalently increased by the amount of the contribution. This stake
amount is then used as voting rights when moderating administrators. An individual with 100 token
contributions would have a voting-weight of 100 when voting to enable or disable an admin. This allows the
contributors of an organization to be able to enable and disable as they see fit. When an active
administrator receives a total amount of disabling votes greater than 50% of the total stakes to the
organization, then the administrator will be disabled from administrator status. Similarly, an inactive
administrator with enabling votes of more than 50% of the total stakes to the organization, then the targeted
account will be enabled as an admin.
